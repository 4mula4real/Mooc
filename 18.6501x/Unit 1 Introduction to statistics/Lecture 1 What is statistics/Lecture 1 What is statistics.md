### Goals of the class



 Welcome to 18.6501x! This class offers an in-depth introduction to the theoretical foundations of statistical methods that are useful in many applications. The goal is to understand the role of mathematics in the research and development of efficient statistical methods. 

 At the end of this class, you will be able to 

1.  From a real-life situation, **formulate a statistical problem in mathematical terms** ; 
2.  Understand the role of mathematics in the design and analysis of statistical methods; 
3. **Select appropriate statistical methods**  for your problem; 
4.  Understand the **implications and limitations of various methods** . 

**Text book recommendation:**  This course does not follow a textbook, but a good reference is *All of Statistics: A Concise Course in Statistical Inference*, by Larry Wasserman. 



### What this course is about



-  Understand the mathematical underpinning of statistical methods. 
-  How to give quantitative statements from modeling assumptions. 
-  Discover mathematical phenomena arising from statistics. 
-  Develop a framework that allows to give mathematical statements about new models. 



### What this course is **not** about



-  How to set up a statistical model for complicated real world examples;
-  Implement statistical computational routines;
-  Learn a lot of different specialized methods.
