**Conditional probability example.** We roll two fair 6-sided dice. Each one of the 36 possible outcomes is assumed to be equally likely.

(a) Find the probability that doubles are rolled (i.e., both dice have the same number).

(b) Given that the roll results in a sum of 4 or less, find the conditional probability that doubles are rolled.

(c) Find the probability that at least one die roll is a 6.

(d) Given that the two dice land on different numbers, find the conditional probability that at least one die roll is a 6.
