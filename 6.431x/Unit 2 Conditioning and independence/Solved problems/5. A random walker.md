**A random walker.** Imagine a drunk tightrope walker, who manages to keep his balance, but takes a step forward with probability p and takes a step back with probability (1âˆ’p).

(a) What is the probability that after two steps, the tightrope walker will be at the same place on the rope as where he started?

(b) What is the probability that after three steps, the tightrope walker will be one step forward from where he started?

(c) Given that after three steps he has managed to move ahead one step, what is the probability that the first step he took was a step forward?
