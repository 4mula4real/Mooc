**A chess tournament problem.** This year's Belmont chess champion is to be selected by the following procedure. Bo and Ci, the leading challengers, first play a two-game match. If one of them wins both games, he gets to play a two-game **second round** with Al, the current champion. Al retains his championship unless a second round is required and the challenger beats Al in both games. If Al wins the initial game of the second round, no more games are played.

Furthermore, we know the following:

- The probability that Bo will beat Ci in any particular game is 0.6.
- The probability that Al will beat Bo in any particular game is 0.5.
- The probability that Al will beat Ci in any particular game is 0.7.

Assume no tie games are possible and all games are independent.

1. Determine the a priori probabilities that
   (a) the second round will be required.
   (b) Bo will win the first round.
   (c) Al will retain his championship this year.

2. Given that the second round is required, determine the conditional probabilities that
   (a) Bo is the surviving challenger.
   (b) Al retains his championship.

3. Given that the second round was required and that it comprised only one game, what is the conditional probability that it was Bo who won the first round?
