# 1. The birthday problem

**The birthday problem.** Consider n people who are attending a party. We assume that every person has an equal probability of being born on any day during the year, independently of everyone else, and ignore the additional complication presented by leap years (i.e., nobody is born on February 29). What is the probability that each person has a distinct birthday?



# 2.Rooks on a chessboard

**Rooks on a chessboard.** Eight rooks are placed in distinct squares of an 8×8 chessboard, with all possible placements being equally likely. Find the probability that all the rooks are safe from one another, i.e., that there is no row or column with more than one rook.



# 3.Hypergeometric probabilities

**Hypergeometric probabilities.** An urn contains n balls, out of which exactly m are red. We select k of the balls at random, without replacement (i.e., selected balls are not put back into the urn before the next selection). What is the probability that i of the selected balls are red?



# 4.Multinomial probabilities

**Multinomial probabilities.** An urn contains balls of r different colors. We draw n balls, with different draws being independent. For any given draw, there is a probability pi, i=1,…,r, of getting a ball of color i. Here, the pi's are nonnegative numbers that sum to 1.

Let n1,…,nr be nonnegative integers that sum to n. What is the probability that we obtain exactly ni balls of color i, for each i=1,…,r?
