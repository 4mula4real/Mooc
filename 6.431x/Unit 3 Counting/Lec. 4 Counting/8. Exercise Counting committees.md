We start with a pool of n people. A chaired committee consists of k≥1 members, out of whom one member is designated as the chairperson. The expression k{n\choose k} can be interpreted as the number of possible chaired committees with k members. This is because we have {n\choose k} choices for the k members, and once the members are chosen, there are then k choices for the chairperson. Thus,


$$
c=\sum _{k=1}^ n k {n \choose k}
$$
is the total number of possible chaired committees of any size.

Find the value of c (as a function of n) by thinking about a different way of forming a chaired committee: first choose the chairperson, then choose the other members of the committee. The answer is of the form
$$
c=(\alpha +n^\beta )2^{\gamma n +\delta }.
$$
What are the values of α, β, γ, and δ?




**Solution:**

We first choose the chairperson, for which there are n choices, and then choose an arbitrary subset of the remaining n−1 people, who will be the remaining committee members. For example, this arbitrary subset could be the empty set, which would mean that the committee is of size 1: only the chairperson. There are 2^{n−1} possible subsets of a set with n−1 elements, and so there are 2^{n−1} ways of choosing the remaining committee members. Thus, an alternative expression for the number of possible chaired committees of any size is n2n−1, from which we can extract the values of α, β, γ, and δ.
