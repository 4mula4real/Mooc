## 1. A linear function of two independent continuous r.v.s

**A linear function of two independent continuous random variables.** Let X and Y be independent continuous random variables. Derive a formula, analogous to the convolution formula, for the PDF of 2X−Y. 



## 2. Simulation

**Simulation.** We have available a random number generator that produces samples of a random variable U which is uniform on [0,1]. Describe a method for generating a sample of a random variable X with known CDF F, for the following cases.

(a) When X is a discrete random variable that takes finitely many values.

(b) When X is continuous, taking values in some interval, and its CDF is strictly monotonic on that interval.

(c) When X is exponential with parameter λ=1.



## 3. Conditional expectation properties

**onditional expectation properties.** Show that:

(a) $E[g(Y)X|Y]=g(Y)E[X|Y]$.

(b) If h is an invertible function, then $E[X|Y]=E[X|h(Y)]$.

Although these facts are true in general, give proofs for the case of discrete random variables.
