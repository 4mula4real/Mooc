## Unit 7 overview

In this unit, we focus on Bayesian inference, including both hypothesis testing and estimation problems.

a) We apply the Bayes rule to find the posterior distribution of an unknown random variable given one or multiple observations of related random variables.

b) We discuss the most common methods for coming up with a point estimate of the unknown random variable (Maximum a Posteriori probability estimate, Least Mean Squares estimate, and Linear Least Mean Squares estimate).

c) We consider the question of performance analysis, namely, the calculation of the probability of error in hypothesis testing problems or the calculation of the mean squared error in estimation problems.

d) To illustrate the methodology, we pay special attention to a few canonical problems such as linear normal models and the problem of estimating the unknown bias of a coin.
