Mathematically, Bayesian inference treats the unknown parameter as a random variable, while Frequentist inference treats the unknown parameter as a constant, and all the differences between the two approaches stem from here. The Bayesian approach leads to posterior distribution of the unknown parameter, and all estimates, including the Bayesian confidence interval, are properties of the posterior distribution. With the Frequentist approach we don't use neither prior no posterior distributions and so have no such universal method of constructing estimates.

When it comes to interpretations, the distribution of the unknown parameter in Bayesian approach is interpreted as modelling our knowledge about the true value of the unknown parameter; so if we have 95% Bayesian confidence interval, we interpret it as the opinion that the true value of the unknown parameter lies within the interval is correct with probability 0.95.

How we interpret this probability 0.95? Here we come to the fundamental difference in Bayesian and Frequentist interpretations of probabilities. Within Bayesian approach, it means that we just subjectively think so, and our subjective thinking is based on our prior knowledge modelled by prior distribution of the unknown parameter and new data that came from observation. We don't give frequency interpretation of probabilities using multiple repetition of probabilistic experiment.
