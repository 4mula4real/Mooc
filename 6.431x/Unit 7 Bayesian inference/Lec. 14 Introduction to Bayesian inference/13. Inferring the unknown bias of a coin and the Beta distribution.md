**Illustration of the update of the posterior distribution.** The file that is linked [here](https://prod-edxapp.edx-cdn.org/assets/courseware/v1/50e83fd161607df26df9fb296bff5650/asset-v1:MITx+6.431x+3T2018+type@asset+block/lectureslides_beta_plots.pdf) illustrates the updating of the Beta posterior distribution of the bias of a coin, as more and more coin flips are observed, starting with a uniform prior (in red, in the figures). Suppose that the true value of the bias is 0.3. We generate independent samples of the coin flips, and each figure shows the resulting posterior (in blue). For example, the third figure shows the posterior if we observe one Heads and one Tails. In order to illustrate the evaluation of the posterior, we also show (in black) all of the previous posteriors. In the last figure, after 64 flips that resulted in 19 Heads, the posterior shown (in blue) is centered in the vicinity of the true value. On the other hand, the posterior has a substantial width, indicating that there is still significant uncertainty about the true value of the coin bias.

**Animation of the update of the posterior distribution.** The [page](http://bl.ocks.org/joost2076/raw/7b0bd5c566b3a349854e/> ) contains an animation of the posterior's updates, with a flexible choice of the underlying parameter p, as created by a past student in this class.
