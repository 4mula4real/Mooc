**The Beta formula.** Show that for any nonnegative integers α and β, we have
$$
\int _0^1 \theta ^\alpha (1-\theta )^{\beta }\,  d\theta =\frac{\alpha !\,  \beta !}{(\alpha +\beta +1)!},
$$
as follows. Let $X_1,…,X_α,Z,Y_1,…,Y_β$ be independent random variables, uniformly distributed on [0,1], and calculate
$$
{\bf P}(X_1<\cdots <X_{\alpha }<Z<Y_1<\cdots <Y_{\beta })
$$
in two different ways. First, using symmetry and, second, by conditioning on the event $Z=θ$.
