**Notes:**

1. **The due dates for the weekly problem sets and the exams are fixed and cannot be changed or modified for any individuals. Please plan accordingly**.
2. Problem set and exam due dates are at the end of the specified date, at 23:59 UTC.
3. The calendar above shows only Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays, since these are the only days of the week when materials will be released or due, except the final exam.



## 3. Grading policy

**Grading policy**

Your overall score in this class will be a weighted average of your scores for the different components, with the following weights:

**20%** for the **lecture exercises** (divided equally among the 26 lectures)
**20%** for the **problem sets** (divided equally among 11 problem sets)
**18%** for the **first midterm exam (timed)** 
**18%** for the **second midterm exam (timed)** 
**24%** for the **final exam (timed)**

(Note that these weights have been updated since released on August 28, 2018).

To earn a verified certificate for this course, you will need to obtain an **overall score of 60%** or more of the maximum possible overall score.

Note that not every problem set or set of lecture exercises will have the same number of raw points. For example, Problem Set 1 may have 30 points and Problem Set 2 may have 35 points. However, each one receives the same weight for the purposes of calculating your overall score.

As an illustrative example, if you receive 20 points out of 30 on Problem Set 1, this will contribute 2030⋅20%11≈1.21% to your overall score. Similarly, if you receive 30 points out of 35 on Problem Set 2, this will contribute 3035⋅20%11≈1.56% to your overall score.

Under the “Progress" tab at the top, you can see your score broken down for each assignment, as well as a summary plot.

**Timed Exams**

The 2 midterm exams and one final exam are **timed exams** . This means that each exam is available for approximately a week, but once you open the exam, there is a limited amount of time (48 hours), counting from when you start, within which you must complete the exam. Please plan in advance for the exams. If you do not complete the whole exam during the allowed time, you will miss the points associated with the questions that have not been answered. The exams are designed to assess your knowledge. **There are no extensions granted to these deadlines**. You can find the exam dates on the calendar on the previous page. 

Note that the timed exams cannot be completed using the edX mobile app.

**MITx Committment to Accessibility**

If you have a disability-related request regarding accessing an MITx course, including exams, please contact the course team as early in the course as possible (at least 2 weeks in advance of exams opening) to allow us time to respond in advance of course deadlines. Requests are reviewed via an interactive process to meet accessibility requirements for learners with disabilities and uphold the academic integrity for MITx.
