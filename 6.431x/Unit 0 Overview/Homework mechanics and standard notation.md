**Checking and submitting an answer**

For each problem, you will have between **2 to 5 attempts** to submit an answer, with the exception of problems where an attempt essentially reveals the answer (e.g., True/False questions), for which you will be limited to a single attempt.

To submit your answer, click the “**Submit** " button. This will automatically submit the problem for grading purposes, and the edX platform is able to verify your answer and give you immediate feedback as to whether or not your answer is correct. To save your answer without submitting it for grading purposes, click the “Save" button. Your answer will be restored when you return to the problem.

The number of attempts allowed as well as the number of attempts you've already made will always be visible on a problem's page at the bottom, next to the “Check" button. Please note that for problems consisting of multiple parts, hitting the button will count as an attempt for all parts of the problem. Unfortunately, it is not possible to submit answers for one part at a time.

For lecture exercises, a “Show Answer(s)" button will appear immediately after you submit the correct answer or use all of your attempts. Clicking this button will reveal the correct answers and solutions.

For homework problems, the “Show Answer(s)" button will appear after the due date of the homework.

You are strongly encouraged to look at the solutions even if your answer is correct.

**Answer formats**

This course will use several answer formats:

- **Multiple choice** : Select the correct option from the dropdown menu or radio buttons.
- **Numerical answers** : Enter a number, either in decimal (e.g., '3.14159') or fractional form (e.g., '22/7'). Do not enter any non-numerical letters or symbols. To account for rounding, the system will accept a range of answers as correct. Unless otherwise specified in the problem, the default tolerance range will be +/-3% of the correct answer.
- **Symbolic answers** : Some problems will ask for a symbolic answer (e.g., 'n*(n+1)/2'). See the next section on “Standard notation" for details on how to submit such answers.

Below are some example problems for you to familiarize yourselves with how these problem types work with different number of attempts. These problems are not graded and have no impact on your grade.



## 2. Standard notation

Many exercises and problems throughout the course will ask you to provide an algebraic answer in terms of symbols. Please follow the guidelines below when entering your responses. Below your answer textbox, the system will also display, in a "pretty" format, what it has interpreted your input to be. However, this display is not perfect (for example, it does not catch all cases of missing close parentheses) so please also check your text input carefully.

- **Symbols are case-sensitive:** **a** and **A** are different – make sure to use the correct case as specified in the problem
- **Parentheses:** make sure that your parentheses are properly balanced – each open parenthesis should have a matching close parenthesis!
- **Elementary arithmetic operations:** use the symbols **+** , **-** , ***** , **/** for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, respectively
  - 1+bc−d/e should be entered as **1+b\*c-d/e**
- **For multiplication, use \* explicitly:**
  - in the example above, enter **b\*c** ; do NOT enter **bc**
  - for 2n(n+1), enter **2\*n*(n+1)** ; do NOT enter **2n(n+1)**
  - although the "pretty" display underneath your answer looks correct if you do not include ***** s, your answer will be marked incorrect!
- **Exponents:** use the symbol **^** to denote exponentiation
  - 2n should be entered as **2^n**
  - xn+1 should be entered as **x^(n+1)**
- **Square root:** use the string of letters **sqrt** , followed by enclosing what is under the square root in parentheses
  - −1 should be entered as **sqrt(-1)**
- **Mathematical constants:** use the symbol **e** for the base of the natural logarithm, e; use the string of letters **pi** for π
  - eiπ+1 should be entered as **e^(i\*(pi))+1**
- **Order of operations:** 1) parentheses, 2) exponents and roots, 3) multiplication and division, 4) addition and subtraction
  - 12πe−x22 should be entered as **(1/sqrt(2\*(pi)))*e^(-(x^2)/2)**
  - **a/b\*c** is interpreted as ab⋅c; enter **a/(b\*c)** for abc
  - When in doubt, use additional parentheses to remove possible ambiguitites
- **Natural logarithm:** although in lectures and solved problems we will sometimes use the notation "log" (instead of "ln"), you should use the string of letters **ln** , followed by the argument enclosed in parentheses
  - ln⁡(2x) should be entered as **ln(2\*x)**
- **Trigonometric functions:** use the usual 3-letter symbols to denote the standard trigonometric functions
  - sin⁡(x) should be entered as **sin(x)**
- **Greek letters:** use the Latin-character name to denote each Greek letter
  - λe−λt should be entered as **lambda\*e^(-lambda*t)**
  - μαθ should be entered as **mu\*alpha*theta**
- **Factorials, permutations, combinations:** you will not need enter these for any symbolic answers; do **NOT** use **!** in your answers as it will not be evaluated correctly!
