**Bonferroni's inequality.**

(a) Prove that for any two events A1 and A2, we have
$$
{\bf P}(A_1 \cap A_2) \geq {\bf P}(A_1) + {\bf P}(A_2)-1.
$$


(b) Generalize to the case of n events A1,A2,â€¦,An, by showing that
$$
{\bf P}(A_1 \cap A_2 \cap \cdots \cap A_ n)\geq {\bf P}(A_1)+{\bf P}(A_2)+\cdots +{\bf P}(A_ n)-(n-1).
$$
