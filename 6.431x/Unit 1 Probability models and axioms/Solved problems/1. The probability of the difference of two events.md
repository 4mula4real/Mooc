**The probability of the difference of two events.** Give a mathematical derivation of the formula
$$
{\bf P}\Big((A \cap B^ c) \cup (A^ c \cap B)\Big)={\bf P}(A)+{\bf P}(B)-2\cdot {\bf P}(A\cap B),
$$
for the probability that exactly one of the events A and B will occur. Your derivation should be a sequence of steps, with each step justified by appealing to one of the probability axioms.
