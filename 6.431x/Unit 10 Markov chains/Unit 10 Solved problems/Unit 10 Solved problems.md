## 1. Setting up a Markov chain

**Setting up a Markov chain.** There are n fish in a lake, some of which are green and the rest blue. Each day, Helen catches 1 fish. She is equally likely to catch any one of the n fish in the lake. She throws back all the fish, but paints each green fish blue before throwing it back in. Let Gicorrespond to the situation where there are i green fish left in the lake.

1. Show how to model this fishing exercise as a Markov chain, where {Gi} are the states. Explain why your model satisfies the Markov property.
2. Find the transition probabilities {pij}.
3. List the transient and the recurrent states.
