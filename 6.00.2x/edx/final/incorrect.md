### Problem 1-2

Consider two normal distributions, A and B. The standard deviation of A is 3 and the standard deviation of B is 5. For each distribution, 1,000 observations are drawn and plotted in a histogram with 10 bins, creating one histogram for each distribution.

The rightmost bin of A will have fewer points than the rightmost bin of B.

The rightmost bin of B will have fewer points than the rightmost bin of A.

The rightmost bin of A will have the same number of points as the rightmost bin of B. 

Any of the above are possible.



I think they are same.
